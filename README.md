# databricks-zero-to-mlops

A four week course on MLOps with Spark and Databricks.  By the end of this course, you will be able to develop ML models using standardized workflows for data processing and model management and maintenance using open-source tools.  This is accomplished by using PySpark and MLflow to build scalable and reproducible solutions using MLOps methodologies.

## Syllabus

## Demos and Deliverables

This course includes a weekly demo video assignment. You will report on the progress of your ongoing project with a 30-90 second video, including screen-casting of your progress.  The reason for this weekly demo is to increase metacognition as well teach other students what you now, thus increasing the learning experience for everyone.
